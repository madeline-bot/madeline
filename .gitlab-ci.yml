# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages

stages: # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - lint
  - build

lint: # This job runs in the lint stage.
  stage: lint # It only starts when the job in the lint stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - pre-commit run --all-files

build: # This job runs in the build stage.
  stage: build # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
